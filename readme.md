- `closeDropdownOutside(e)`: Closes the dropdown when clicking elsewhere
- `changeTheme(theme)`: Updates the current theme and saves preference
- `loadSavedTheme()`: Loads the saved theme on application start

### Utility Functions

## Responsive Design

The application adjusts layout for different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full layout with sidebar
